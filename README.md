ID : CTO8DS7633
DOMAIN: WEB DEVELOPMENT
DURATION: AUGUST TO SPETEMBER 2024

Project Overview: Weather Forecast App
A.Objective:
The Weather Forecast App is designed to provide users with current weather information based on a specified location. This web application allows users to enter a location name and receive real-time data on temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, the app displays relevant weather icons to enhance the user experience. The primary goal is to deliver a functional and visually appealing tool that demonstrates the integration of web technologies with an external weather API.

B.Key Activities:
1.Project Planning and Design: Define the features and functionality required for the weather forecast app.
Design wireframes and user interface mockups to outline the layout and visual elements.
2.Front-End Development:
HTML: Structure the web page with input fields, buttons, and areas to display weather information.
CSS: Style the application to create a visually appealing and responsive design, including weather icons and data presentation.
JavaScript: Implement the logic to fetch weather data from an API, handle user input, and update the interface with temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons.
3.API Integration:
Integrate with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve current weather data based on user input.
Handle API responses and errors to ensure smooth user experience.
4.Testing and Debugging:
Test the app for various locations to ensure accuracy and reliability of the weather data.
Debug any issues related to data fetching, UI updates, and responsiveness.
5.Documentation and Deployment:
Write clear and comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and features of the app.
Prepare the GitHub repository with a detailed README file, including installation instructions and project details.

C.Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the applicationâ€™s content.
CSS: For styling the app, including responsive design and weather icons.
JavaScript: For fetching weather data from the API, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the UI.
Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap): For retrieving real-time weather information.

D.Features:
Location Input: Enter the name of a location to get the current weather data.
Weather Data Display: Shows temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the specified location.
Weather Icons: Visual representation of weather conditions using relevant icons.
Responsive Design: Ensures the app works well on different devices and screen sizes.
